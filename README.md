Property of Henk Hsiung and Paolo Caraos



Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Android Build Tools v23.0.2
- Android Support Repository


Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradle build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.


How-to-Play
---------------
The orange flying creature (Charizard) represents the player. The player travels through a dungeon with obstacles, items and enemies. The player can move by clicking the arrow keys. The player can shoot by clicking the target symbol in the middle of the arrow keys. If the player touches the enemy, the player begins to lose health. To advance to the next level, the player must find and kill all enemies within the dungeon. Once the player reaches the next level, the player regains full health, and is able to shoot more projectiles.

The game ends when either the player's health drops to 0 or completes all three levels.

Notes
---------------
Our level starts at 98 and ends at 100
In order to allow more flexibility with the level design, not all levels have terrain serving as borders around the dungeon.
Enemies can spawn within the terrain.
